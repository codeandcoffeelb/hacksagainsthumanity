# hacksagainsthumanity
A working repo for a future event

Hacks Against Humanity (HAH!) is the working name for a future hackathon event, born out of common frustrations with other events:

* High falutin' mission statements - "we want you to save endagered species... by spending a week hacking on crappy code" - that never seem to pan out
* Feelings of exploitation by marketing droids who just want the personal benefit of association with hackers, and think you'll work on their vision for pizza and beer.
* Missing the fun and comaraderie that hackathons should embody
* A crushing lack of creativity

Instead, HAH! will focus on the exact opposite:

* Creative irreverence rewarded, bland discouraged
* Hacking for the sheer, absurd fun of it
* Work on what you want to - the more unexpectedly personal the better
* Competition for its own sake
* Did I mention fun?

Right now this is just a concept - we have little more than the name to go on - but we believe there's an opportunity here to have fun, hack together, and... keep it real, yo.
